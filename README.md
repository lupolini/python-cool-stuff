# Mathematical division that rounds down to nearest integer.

The floor division operator is //.

For example, the expression 11 // 4 evaluates to 2 in contrast to the 2.75 returned by float true division.


- Python3:
```
print ( 11//4 )
# 2
print( 11/4 )
# 2.75
```
Note that (-11) // 4 is -3 because that is -2.75 rounded downward
```
print ( -11//4 )
# -3 
print ( -11/4 )
# -2.75 
```

- Python2:
```
print ( 11//4 )
# 2 
print ( 11/4 )
# 2 

print ( -11//4 )
# -3 
# print ( -11/4 )
-3 
```


# Combined multiply and assignment
```
somevar = '*' 
somevar *= 33
print(somevar)
