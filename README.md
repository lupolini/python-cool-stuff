Mathematical division that rounds down to nearest integer.

The floor division operator is //.

For example, the expression 11 // 4 evaluates to 2 in contrast to the 2.75 returned by float true division.


- Python3:
```
> print ( 11//4 )
> 2
> print( 11/4 )
2.75
```
Note that (-11) // 4 is -3 because that is -2.75 rounded downward
```
> print ( -11//4 )
> -3 
> print ( -11/4 )
> -2.75 
```

- Python2:
```
> print ( 11//4 )
> 2 
> print ( 11/4 )
> 2 

> print ( -11//4 )
> -3 
> print ( -11/4 )
> -3 
```
